# COVID Portfolio Project: Data Exploration

## Overview
This project involves exploring and analyzing a dataset related to COVID-19 using SQL. The focus is on extracting meaningful insights, summarizing key metrics, and answering critical questions about the pandemic's trends and impacts.

## Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze COVID-19 data to understand trends such as case counts, death rates, and recovery rates.
- **Query Optimization**: Use SQL queries to efficiently extract and process data.
- **Visualization Prep**: Organize the data in a format suitable for visualization and reporting.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL Database**: MySQL or any SQL-based RDBMS.
- **SQL IDE**: MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio, or equivalent.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Import the dataset into the SQL database.
2. **Schema Design**: Understand and work with the table schema.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
4. **Query Development**: Write SQL queries to analyze the data.
5. **Result Analysis**: Interpret query results to derive insights.

## Key SQL Concepts Used
- **SELECT Statements**: Extract specific columns and rows of interest.
- **WHERE Clauses**: Filter data based on conditions.
- **Aggregations**: Use of `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `COUNT` to summarize data.
- **Joins**: Combine multiple tables to extract relevant information.
- **Window Functions**: Use `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, and `PARTITION BY` for advanced analysis.
- **Temporary Tables**: Store intermediate results for complex queries.

## Key Insights and Queries
1. **Total Cases and Deaths by Country**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Country, SUM(Cases) AS TotalCases, SUM(Deaths) AS TotalDeaths
   FROM covid_data
   GROUP BY Country;
   ```

2. **Daily Increase in Cases**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Date, Country, Cases - LAG(Cases) OVER (PARTITION BY Country ORDER BY Date) AS DailyIncrease
   FROM covid_data;
   ```

3. **Top 10 Countries with Highest Cases**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Country, SUM(Cases) AS TotalCases
   FROM covid_data
   GROUP BY Country
   ORDER BY TotalCases DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Recovery Rate by Country**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Country, SUM(Recovered) * 100.0 / SUM(Cases) AS RecoveryRate
   FROM covid_data
   GROUP BY Country;
   ```

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the project repository.
2. Set up the SQL database and import the provided dataset.
3. Execute the SQL scripts sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau for better insight presentation.
- Automate the data cleaning and analysis pipeline using Python or R.
- Include data from other sources (e.g., vaccination rates) for a more comprehensive analysis.
